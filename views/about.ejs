            <h3>How does ToSS know whether a statement is good or bad?</h3>
            <p>ToSS is designed to follow <a href="https://www.privacy.gov.ph/data-privacy-act/" target="_blank">R.A. 10173 or the Data Privacy Act of 2012</a>, which means it follows the Philippine guidelines for protecting and managing privacy.</p>

            <h3>Can I use the results of ToSS for legal actions?</h3>
            <p>ToSS is a tool to keep privacy policies simple for the general public since most of these documents are hard to read. However, it does not evaluate statements to be legal or not. It only suggests that the privacy statement analyzed could be unfavorable to a person if he/she agreed to it.</p>
